# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Davin Patel

Time spent: 5-6 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

n/a

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

Without a doubt, the biggest challenge I faced when working on this project was trying to familiarize myself with new programming languages. 
Before I completed the project I had only programmed in Java, C++, and a tiny amount of Python. My experience with these languages greatly contributed to 
my understanding of the logic and concepts that the project touched on, yet it also confused me in the process. Being familiar with the syntax of other 
languages made it difficult at times to get used to the format of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Specifically, opening tags and adding attributes to them was 
a foreign concept that I had not encountered before. Additionally, the more straightforward wording of CSS threw me for a loop, as I’ve become accustomed 
to the more complicated syntax of C++. However, the biggest challenge I had when adjusting to programming in new languages was understanding how each of 
the individual files connected to each other. I wasn’t aware that files written in JavaScript could utilize and reference files written in HTML or CSS. 
Trying to understand how each file connected to the others–especially since each file was in a different language–proved to be a challenging experience. 
While this new concept did initially present itself as a challenge, I found that by reading the useful explanations in the instructions and then observing 
and applying those explanations to the project itself, I was able to more clearly understand the concept. I believe that this project was a great demonstration 
of the power that applying newly learned concepts can have in helping someone understand and build familiarity with those ideas.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I felt that this project was a fascinating window into the world of web development. It was a fulfilling experience to slowly watch the functionality of the game 
come together piece by piece through small blocks of code. A persisting question that I still have after completing the game is what the limits of programming 
languages used in web development are. For example, the websites of corporations are often extremely modern, with complex animations and extremely polished looks. 
How are these types of websites developed? Are there planning stages in which web developers determine the look and themes they’re trying to achieve? What are the 
more complex elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enable these developers to create these types of websites. Overall, I believe that being able to learn the
process of web development–from conception to launch–and the more advanced tools that web developers use, would be super interesting to learn more about.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

One of the features that I think would be fun to implement if I had extra time to work on the project is the addition of levels of difficulty. The user could select 
from three modes of difficulty, with each level containing a different number of buttons. For example, the project in its current state could be the easy difficulty 
level. For the medium level, the number of buttons could increase by two and the pattern could play faster. For the hard level, the number of buttons and the speed 
of the pattern could increase again. By adding these different levels, the game could appeal to an audience that enjoys varying levels of challenge. Another modification 
I would make if time permitted would be making the game interface cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing. In it’s current state, while good, the interface looks slightly
dated. I would experiment with different styles and fonts in the CSS file to find a combination that looks more modern while still staying true to the web game style.
